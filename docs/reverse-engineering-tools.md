# Reverse-engineering tool integrations

REA can call caller-supplied GNU objdump, GDB, and Rizin installations. REA does not install or update these tools. Static objdump/Rizin workflows use the same services from CLI and MCP. GDB supports persistent MCP sessions and an ephemeral CLI command. Persistent debugger sessions exist only for the lifetime of the REA MCP server process.

## GNU objdump

`inspect_with_objdump` and `rea inspect-with-objdump` capture stdout and stderr as inline Evidence. Evidence records SHA-256 digests before and after the provider call and whether those observed digests differ; this cannot prove the exact bytes consumed if the artifact changes during execution. Choose one operation: `file_headers`, `section_headers`, `symbols`, `relocations`, `dwarf`, `disassemble`, `disassemble_all`, or `architectures`. `disassemble` maps to `-d`; `disassemble_all` maps to `-D` and has different symbol-boundary semantics. `architectures` maps to `-i` and reports BFD targets compiled into the installed binary, not a guarantee that a target is supported.

For DWARF, REA does not follow local debug links by default. Set `follow_debug_links` to `true` to pass `-WK`; external debug-file identities are not bound to Evidence when following links is enabled. The CLI option is `--follow-debug-links true`. REA clears `DEBUGINFOD_URLS` in the objdump child environment to disable debuginfod network access on GNU binutils versions that do not support `-WE`. The complete raw output is authoritative; REA does not normalize it into a version-independent disassembly schema.

```sh
rea inspect-with-objdump ./program disassemble
rea inspect-with-objdump ./program dwarf --follow-debug-links false
```

Captured stdout and stderr are retained up to a 16 MiB combined limit; `output_truncated` marks output beyond that limit.

## GDB

`start_gdb_session`, `gdb_console`, `gdb_session_status`, and `close_gdb_session` manage a persistent GDB/MI session in MCP. The one-shot CLI equivalent requires a caller-selected durable TTY: `rea debug-with-gdb --inferior-tty /dev/pts/7 'file ./program'`. The TTY must remain available after GDB exits so a detached inferior can continue writing. MCP starts GDB with `--nx --quiet --interpreter=mi3`, retries initialization with MI2 if MI3 initialization returns an error and cleanup succeeds, waits for its prompt, and disables auto-loading. Pass optional `inferior_tty` to select the terminal that future inferior runs use; REA configures it before the session becomes ready and checks the exact value with GDB/MI. `gdb_session_status` reports the selected path and whether REA still considers the configuration verified. Commands that can change inferior output settings or redirect a run revoke that verification, so close retains GDB ownership if a live inferior remains. The console remains unrestricted and can run shell commands, change target state, access files, and use network in the REA process user's security context. Raw MI records and console/target/log streams are returned with Evidence; command output is retained up to 16 MiB and explicitly marked when truncated. Persistent GDB debugger sessions are unavailable on Windows because REA cannot safely distinguish the debugger from its inferior processes during job cleanup.

Before a normal close, REA checks for live GDB thread groups. If one remains and a durable `inferior_tty` is verified, REA asks GDB to detach it and confirms the detach before stopping the debugger. Without that sink, select and apply a disposition to each inferior through `gdb_console` (for example, detach or kill as appropriate), then retry close. REA never infers target ownership from a PID or path. When the MCP server shuts down, REA terminates only its directly owned GDB process after confirming no inferior or a sink-backed detach; otherwise it retains the process and its output streams for retry.

```text
start_gdb_session {"inferior_tty":"/dev/pts/7"}
gdb_console {"session_id":"…","command":"file ./program"}
gdb_console {"session_id":"…","command":"info files"}
gdb_session_status {"session_id":"…"}
close_gdb_session {"session_id":"…"}
```

## Rizin

`execute_rizin_command` and `rea execute-rizin-command` run one selected command against a local artifact. The one-shot profile uses `-N -q -c`, suppressing user settings and scripts while leaving plugins available. Commands and plugins run with the REA process user's security context and may access files, the network, or perform other actions. REA preserves raw output and does not claim that command-specific JSON has one universal schema.

```sh
rea execute-rizin-command ./program iI
```

Captured stdout and stderr are retained up to a 16 MiB combined limit; `output_truncated` marks output beyond that limit.

## Configuration and coverage

The optional `REA_OBJDUMP_COMMAND`, `REA_GDB_COMMAND`, and `REA_RIZIN_COMMAND` values select executable names or paths; otherwise REA searches `PATH`. Values are passed directly to process spawning, not expanded as shell command lines. Provider versions and capabilities remain unknown until observed from the installed tool and verified in the corresponding real-provider lane.

Provider capture limits are separate from the MCP response budget. A result that fits the provider limit may still exceed the default 10 MiB MCP response budget and return a transport `resource_constraint`. Configure `REA_MCP_MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES` to match a larger client receive buffer when that client supports one; otherwise use retained Evidence/export or complete CLI JSON output. See [MCP response limits](./mcp-contracts.md#tool-results).
